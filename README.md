![PXL_20221106_115325305](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9034190/200169928-774e8d37-b74c-4af1-be72-d358b06c66c8.jpg)
For my first ever Arduino project, I was able to follow the excellent instructions for the "StreamDeck Killer" here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=vTWakhkdjO0


The scripts included in the refernce files are for PC apps. I created two screens of my own for my Mac. Enjoy.


(Oh, I use Alfred for search not Spotlight. I use the key combination OPTION SPACE to open apps. If you use Spotlight, just change the scripts from OPTION SPACE to COMMAND SPACE and test.)
